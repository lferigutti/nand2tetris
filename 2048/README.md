# Game 2048 in Jack Language

This is the classic game 2048 implemented in the Jack language for the Hack computer.

## How to play
1. Go to: https://nand2tetris.github.io/web-ide/compiler
2. Click the folder, then compile and run.
3. Slide the Speed slider to the fastest setting in the VM emulator.
4. Run the program.
5. Enable the keyboard.
6. Use the arrow keys to play.

## Missing features
* Spawn random 4s (currently only 2s)
* Add scoreboard.
* Polish the UI.
* Implement graphical (not text-based) drawing—this is quite complex.

Board rotation is used to simplify movement logic, rather than implementing each direction separately. This idea was inspired by CS61B, Spring 2021. Thanks to John: https://sp21.datastructur.es/
